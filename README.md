# SQL Developer Internship - Task 4

##  Task Title:
**Aggregate Functions and Grouping**

##  Objective:
To use SQL aggregate functions along with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses to summarize and analyze tabular data effectively.

## Tools Used:
- DB Browser for SQLite
- MySQL Workbench

## Task Overview:
In this task, I worked with sample tables (`employees` and `orders`) and applied SQL aggregate functions such as:
- `SUM()`
- `AVG()`
- `COUNT()`
- `MAX()`
- `MIN()`

I also used `GROUP BY` to group records based on department, employee ID, or order status, and used `HAVING` to filter those grouped results.

## Key Concepts Applied:
- **Aggregation:** Calculating totals, averages, and counts from a dataset.
- **Grouping:** Categorizing records using `GROUP BY`.
- **Filtering Groups:** Applying conditions using `HAVING` instead of `WHERE`.
- **Formatting Results:** Using `ROUND()` for better output formatting.
- **Conditional Grouping:** Categorizing data using `CASE WHEN` inside `GROUP BY`.

##  What I Did:
- Designed and populated realistic datasets for `employees` and `orders`.
- Wrote 18+ SQL queries that summarize data in different ways.
- Applied grouping to:
  - Count employees by department
  - Sum orders by employee
  - Find average salary and filter using `HAVING`
- Practiced real-world scenarios like:
  - Filtering departments with high average salaries
  - Getting highest salaries per department
  - Calculating total order amounts per status
  - Grouping salary ranges using conditional logic

##  Outcome:
This task helped me strengthen my skills in analyzing and summarizing data using SQL. I now understand how to:
- Efficiently use `GROUP BY` with multiple columns
- Apply conditional logic and filtering on grouped data
- Prepare summary reports from raw datasets

##  Deliverables:
- SQL script with all aggregation and grouping queries
- README file with approach, concepts, and learning outcomes
